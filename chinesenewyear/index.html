            <div><p>some preacher was spreading gospel on the tv. my mom questioned him, "why, why did god create us to suffer?" and i said, "i'm not so sure." she said "to train you, to train you." </p></div>

            <div><p>it's chinese new year and i've started this year getting rained on. i started this year with a cold shower and snot running down my face. i don't want to talk about it, i don't know what to say about it. tomorrow, i might not remember it.</p></div>

            <div><p>i cried in your arms, i cried in my car. i tried to hug myself tenderly but it was just desperate clawing. the shakey breaths from my lungs sounded rugged. a little trapped animal trying to burrow into a hole. i knew there would be no one to greet me when i came home.</p></div>

            <div><p>my mother, made me dinner. she made me dinner and said i wasn't inconveniencing her. my father offered me cookies. he said i could get anything i wanted. they only do this because they don't know me. this isn't my home, but still, it is comforting.</p></div>

            <div><p>i said killing you isn't worth another. "she's everything to me though, how could you say she's not worth enough." not enough to kill, not enough to hurt. not enough to feel full on another's meal.</p></div>

            <div><p>i'm not allowed to laugh. i'm not allowed to cry. i'm not allowed to lie. soon, i began wondering, "what am i allowed to do?" the ribbon around my neck began looking like a leash, choking me as i back off.</p></div>

            <div><p>i wonder if i'm actually strong or if i'm just pretending. just pretending because i have to.</p></div>

            <div><p>when she stepped outside, i couldn't look. i averted my eyes. i regretted it, i wasn't sure if i would ever see her again. when she came back around the block, i stared. i want it, but i don't need it.</p></div>

            <div><p>i'm shaking, choking on my own spit.</p></div>
