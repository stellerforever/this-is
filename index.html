            <div><p>i've been dreaming in strange ways recently. </p></div>

            <div><p>i woke up this morning and the last words you said to me were: "you don't have to feel good." all this with tears in your dream eyes and i wondered if i've just been being selfish, this whole time.</p></div>

            <div><p>before this all happened: i had a dream i was in your arms on the floor and you bit me. the blood squirted on the ground, you thought it was something else and we both looked shocked.</p></div>

            <div><p>in other dreams, i remember tender moments. things that feel so shameless, so ugly and somehow were still so beautiful. i don't know how to take it all back. i don't know if i can. all i can say is that i'm sorry, i care for you. please, know i care. please, know i want to hold you. please, know i want to make it better, even if there's no way i can.</p></div>

            <div><p>i keep looking at you through doorways, hoping you'll see me and smile back. a simple smile with no disdain behind those eyes. i know even wishing this is selfish. i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i'm sorry.</p></div>

            <div><p>last night, after i ran away from you. i walked home in the cold. i smoked a cigarette and cherished the tingles in my legs and the bite of the cold air on my arms. i remembered old things that i've lost on those sidewalks, i remembered the hopelessness i felt back then, and for a moment i felt strong. i felt strong to be able to walk in the cold dark night alone. i sat down on an old stoop, and i wrote down, "maybe, life is being okay with losing- to love so hard that losing hurts." after i sat down the rush came back to me, i felt sick, i could hardly get home, smelling like fire, i threw up. i threw up and i laughed, "haha, i finally got it all out."</p></div>
