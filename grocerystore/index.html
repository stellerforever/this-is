            <div><p>sitting, back straight, on my spot in the couch. i can feel my heart beat through my ribs.</p></div>

            <div><p>my dad begged me not to leave. my mom cooked for me. she made us hot chocolate in the tiny little cups with the tiny little spoons. they gave me chocolate covered strawberries and told me happy valentines day. the world is still spinning, i am still alive, and somebody loves me. i hugged my mother for the first time in a while. thank you.</p></div>

            <div><p>i stopped at the grocery store, listened to loud music on the way. each word i sang was a strange sort of scream, leaching out of me.</p></div>

            <div><p>the produce at the store was so green. all the best vegetables were there. i tried to grab them, they fell on the linoleum. i was walking away, pretending i didn't see. "miss! miss! are you not gonna pick that up, huh? you're just gonna walk away, huh?" i stared at her. she pretended not to see me, i couldn't say anything back, i put them back and wondered why she needed to hold this power over me and if she thought she was a better person for it.</p></div>

            <div><p>at home i lit candles and incense. i pour myself coffee, i brew myself tea. ah, this is my favorite thing. the house is cold, i hug myself, and accidentally fall asleep. a dreamless, desperate sleep. when i wake, my arms are still around my waist, my tea has gone cold, i fall asleep again. will i be a better person when i wake up?</p></div>
